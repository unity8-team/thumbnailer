/**
\brief A cache of key-value pairs with persistent storage.

PersistentStringCache provides a cache of key-value pairs with a backing store.
It is intended for caching arbitrary (possibly large) amounts of data,
such as might be needed by a web browser cache. The cache scales to large
numbers (hundreds of thousands) of entries and is very fast. (Typically,
the performance limiting factor is the I/O bandwidth to disk.)

A cache has a maximum size (which can be changed at any time). Once
the cache reaches its maximum size, when adding an entry,
the cache automatically discards enough entries to make room for the new entry.

Keys can be (possibly binary) strings of size &gt; 0. Values can be
(possibly binary) strings including the empty string.

Entries maintain an access time, which is used to keep them in
least-recently-used (LRU) order. In addition, entries can have
an optional expiry time. (If no expiry time is specified, infinite
expiry time is assumed.)

\note This class is thread-safe; you can call member functions from
different threads without any synchronization. Thread-safety is
provided for convenience, not performance. Calling concurrently
into the cache from multiple threads will not yield improved performance.

### Discard Policy

The cache provides two different discard policies, `lru_ttl`
and `lru_only`.

For `lru_ttl`, the discard policy of the cache is to first delete all
entries that have expired. If this does not free sufficient space
to make room for a new entry, the cache then deletes entries in oldest
to newest (LRU) order until sufficient space is available. This
deletion in LRU order may delete entries that have an
expiry time, but have not expired yet, as well as entries with
infinite expiry time.

For `lru_only`, entries do not maintain an expiry time and
are therefore discarded strictly in LRU order.

Access and expiry times are recorded with millisecond granularity.
To indicate infinite expiry time, use the defaulted parameter value or
`chrono::steady_clock::time_point()`.

Methods throw `std::runtime_error` if the underlying database
(leveldb) fails. If leveldb detects database corruption, the code
throws `std::system_error` with with a 666 error code. To recover
from this error, remove all files in the cache directory.
Other errors are indicated by throwing `std::logic_error` or
`std::invalid_argument` as appropriate.

### Additional data

Besides storing key-value pairs, the cache allows you to add arbitrary
extra data to each entry. This is useful, for example, to maintain
metadata (such as HTTP header details) for the entries in the cache.

\warning It is not possible to distinguish between "no metadata was ever added"
and "empty metadata was added and retrieved". Do not use the metadata in such
a way that you rely the difference between "metadata not there" and
"metadata is the empty string".

### Performance

Some rough performance figures, taken on an Intel Ivy Bridge i7-3770K 3.5 GHz
with 16 GB RAM, appear below. Records are filled with random data to make them non-compressible.

After filling the cache, the code performs cache lookups using random
keys, with an 80% hit probability. On a miss, it inserts a new
random record. This measures the typical steady-state behavior:
whenever a cache miss happens, the caller fetches the data and
inserts a new record into the cache.

Setting     | Value
----------  | ------
Cache size  | 100 MB
Headroom    |   5 MB
# Records   | ~5120
Record size | 20 kB, normal distribution, stddev = 7000

Running the test With a 7200 rpm spinning disk produces:

Parameter    | Value
-------------|------------
Reads        | 30.9 MB/sec
Writes       | 7.0 MB/sec
Records/sec  | 1995

Running the test With an Intel 256 GB SSD produces:

Parameter    | Value
-------------|------------
Reads        | 112.6 MB/sec
Writes       | 25.7 MB/sec
Records/sec  | 7112

\note When benchmarking, make sure to compile in release mode. In debug
mode, a number of expensive assertions are turned on.

\note Also be aware that leveldb uses Snappy compression beneath the
covers. This means that, if test data is simply filled with
a fixed byte pattern, you will measure artificially high performance.
